# General Instructions for Copilot

- Use `function` instead of `class` for the implementation even  if if it demands a class like `cqrs` with `builder` patter to keep the logic simple and easy to understand.

- for documentation we use `mdx` files in `packages/apps/docs/content`, these files should be organized by module and should include examples and usage guidelines for the components. and they should be written in a way that is easy to understand and follow that uses [fumadocs](https://fumadocs.dev/llms.txt).

- for the icons we will use the `lucide` icon library, you can find the icons [here](https://lucide.dev/icons).
