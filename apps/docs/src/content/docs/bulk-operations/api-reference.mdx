---
The Drizzle Service provides high-performance bulk operations that allow you to efficiently process multiple records using automatic batching. These operations are optimized for performance, memory efficiency, and provide comprehensive error handling for batch processing scenarios.

## Key Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for processing large datasets with minimal database round trips
- **Automatic Batching**: Splits large operations into configurable batch sizes for better performance and memory management
- **Individual Record Processing**: Each record is processed individually within batches for granular error handling
- **Granular Error Handling**: Tracks success and failure rates with detailed error reporting per record
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with compile-time validation
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes large datasets without excessive memory usage through batching
- **Soft Delete Support**: Bulk soft delete operations respect service soft delete configuration
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Before and after hooks for custom business logic


## Available Operations

### Bulk Mutation Operations

| Operation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `bulkCreate(data[])` | Create multiple records in batches without transactions |
| `bulkUpdate(updates[])` | Update multiple records individually with granular error tracking |
| `bulkDelete(ids[])` | Soft delete multiple records in batches (respects soft delete configuration) |
| `bulkHardDelete(ids[])` | Permanently delete multiple records in batches |
| `bulkRestore(ids[])` | Restore multiple soft-deleted records in batches |

## bulkCreate()

Create multiple records efficiently in a single database transaction.

```ts
bulkCreate(
  data: T['$inferInsert'][],
  hooks?: ServiceHooks<T>
): Handler<T['$inferSelect'][]>
```

### Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    data: {
      description: 'Array of objects containing data for new records',
      type: 'T[\'$inferInsert\'][]',
      required: true
    },
    hooks: {
      description: 'Optional service hooks for lifecycle events',
      type: 'ServiceHooks<T>',
    }
  }}
/>

### Returns

Returns a `Handler<T['$inferSelect'][]>` which is a promise that resolves to:
- `[null, records[]]` - Success case with array of created records
- `[error, null]` - Error case with detailed error information

---

## bulkUpdate()

Update multiple records with individual change sets in a single transaction.

```ts
bulkUpdate(
  data: Array<{
    id: IdType<T, TOpts>;
    changes: Partial<Omit<T['$inferInsert'], 'createdAt' | 'id'>>;
  }>,
  hooks?: ServiceHooks<T>
): Handler<T['$inferSelect'][]>
```

### Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    data: {
      description: 'Array of update objects containing ID and changes for each record',
      type: 'Array<{ id: IdType<T, TOpts>; changes: Partial<Omit<T[\'$inferInsert\'], \'createdAt\' | \'id\'>>; }>',
      required: true
    },
    hooks: {
      description: 'Optional service hooks for lifecycle events',
      type: 'ServiceHooks<T>',
    }
  }}
/>

### Returns

Returns a `Handler<T['$inferSelect'][]>` which is a promise that resolves to:
- `[null, records[]]` - Success case with array of updated records
- `[error, null]` - Error case with detailed error information

---

## bulkDelete()

Delete multiple records by their primary keys, respecting soft delete configuration.

```ts
bulkDelete(
  ids: IdType<T, TOpts>[],
  hooks?: ServiceHooks<T>
): Promise<{ readonly success: boolean; readonly message?: string }>
```

### Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    ids: {
      description: 'Array of primary key values for records to delete',
      type: 'IdType<T, TOpts>[]',
      required: true
    },
    hooks: {
      description: 'Optional service hooks for lifecycle events',
      type: 'ServiceHooks<T>',
    }
  }}
/>

### Returns

Returns a promise that resolves to a result object:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    success: {
      description: 'Whether the bulk delete operation completed successfully',
      type: 'boolean',
      required: true
    },
    message: {
      description: 'Optional human-readable description of the operation result',
      type: 'string',
    }
  }}
/>

### Behavior

- **With Soft Delete**: Updates the configured soft delete field for all specified records
- **Without Soft Delete**: Permanently removes all specified records from the database

---

## bulkHardDelete()

Permanently delete multiple records from the database, bypassing soft delete configuration.

```ts
bulkHardDelete(
  ids: IdType<T, TOpts>[],
  hooks?: ServiceHooks<T>
): Promise<{ readonly success: boolean; readonly message?: string }>
```

### Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    ids: {
      description: 'Array of primary key values for records to permanently delete',
      type: 'IdType<T, TOpts>[]',
      required: true
    },
    hooks: {
      description: 'Optional service hooks for lifecycle events',
      type: 'ServiceHooks<T>',
    }
  }}
/>

### Returns

Returns a promise that resolves to a result object:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    success: {
      description: 'Whether the bulk hard delete operation completed successfully',
      type: 'boolean',
      required: true
    },
    message: {
      description: 'Optional human-readable description of the operation result',
      type: 'string',
    }
  }}
/>

### Behavior

Always performs permanent deletion regardless of soft delete configuration.

## Type Definitions

### Handler

<TypeTable
  type={{
    '[0]': {
      description: 'Error object if operation failed, null if successful',
      type: 'Error | null',
      required: true
    },
    '[1]': {
      description: 'Result data if operation succeeded, null if failed',
      type: 'T | null',
      required: true
    }
  }}
/>

### ServiceHooks

<TypeTable
  type={{
    beforeAction: {
      description: 'Called before the action is performed',
      type: '(data: T[\'$inferSelect\']) => Promise<void>',
    },
    afterAction: {
      description: 'Called after the action is successfully completed',
      type: '(data: T[\'$inferSelect\']) => Promise<void>',
    },
    onError: {
      description: 'Called when an error occurs during the action',
      type: '(error: Error) => Promise<void>',
    }
  }}

  type={{
    type: {
      description: 'The type of the primary key field, inferred from the table schema or service options',
      type: 'string | number | bigint',
